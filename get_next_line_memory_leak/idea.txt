get_next_line with buffer_sizei- function allows: read, malloc, free- buffer_size will be set on header file
Nanoutils.c file only allow 5 helper functionsExample about reading:


- int res = read (fd, buffer, buffer_size) will return int value. If res == -1 -> error.
- buffer will store buffer_size bytes from reading files 
and the system will point to buffer_size position in content of file.
- every time we called the buffer -> it will overwrite the buffer file -> we need a variable temp_buffer to store it.
- we need to detect '\n' or 'EOF' character in buffer
	+ If yes
		* split the character from start to finding position and print it out.
		* check how much remaining characters
		* remaining character will move to join with temp_buffer
	+ If no
		*
- temp_buffer will:
	+ store char from buffer.
	+ detect '\n' or  'EOF' character in the content
		o If yes
			* split the character from start to '\n' and print out it.
			* the remaining character must be stored for next.
		o If no
			* check how many characters need to join to temp_buffer
			* join buffer to temp_buffer.
